openapi: get /api/v1/veo/get-1080p-video
---

Get the high-definition 1080P version of a Veo3 video generation task.

## Usage Instructions

- **16:9 Aspect Ratio Only**: Only videos with 16:9 aspect ratio support 1080P HD video generation
- **Automatic Generation**: After the original video generation is successful, the system will automatically start generating the 1080P HD version
- **Additional Processing Time**: 1080P video generation requires additional processing time, please wait some time after the original video generation is completed before calling this endpoint
- **Status Check**: If the 1080P video is not ready yet, the endpoint may return error information

<Warning>
Only successfully generated video tasks can obtain 1080P versions. We recommend waiting a few minutes after receiving the video generation success callback before calling this endpoint.
</Warning>
